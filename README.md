# Description
<p>SwiftDataExmpl project is a very simple app which is developed to learn how SwiftData, Charts and Algorithms works all together.<br>
The project consists of a simple list of expenses which the user can add update and delete. They are chunked by month and persisted locally.</p>

# Getting started
1. Make sure you have the Xcode version 14.0 or above installed on your computer.<br>
2. Download the SwiftDataExmpl project files from the repository.<br>
3. Open the project files in Xcode.<br>
4. Make sure the <strong>swift-algorithms</strong> packages are downloaded successfully.<br>
5. Run the active scheme.<br>

You should see an empty expenses list on the screen.<br>
You should see a main button that allows you to add the first expense to the list.<br>

# Usage
In order to start managing your expenses, you should tap on the plus button "+" on the top right of the screen, which will take you to an empty form.<br>
There you can fill the expense form and tap on the "Save" button on the top right of the screen to save and close the form.<br>
Once the new expense is added you can see it on the list.<br>
In order to edit an existing expense you should tap on it.<br>
In order to delete an expense you should swipe left the list item and tap the red "Delete" button.<br>

# Architecture
* SwiftDataExmpl project is implemented using the <strong>Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)</strong> architecture pattern.

* Model has any necessary data structure needed to generate the expense.
* ViewModel is bridge between the Model and the View. It provides data and behavior to the View, allowing it to bind directly to the ViewModel properties and commands.
* View is responsible for displaying the user interface to the end user. It receives input from the user and presents the data provided by the ViewModel.
* Project implements a local SwiftData sql3 database.<br><br>

# Structure
<p>ðŸš§ In construction ðŸš§</p> 
* "ViewModel": View logic that handled user data and refresh user interface.
* "View": User interfaces like main view.
* "Components": Sub views that main view includes like add and update sheets.
* "Model": Entities needed by the app like expenses.

# Running the tests
<p>ðŸš§ In construction ðŸš§</p>
<p>The SwiftDataExmpl project can be tested using the built-in framework XCTest.<br>
To start testing the project, you will need to change to the 'SwiftDataExmplTests' target in your Xcode project, and then just run the tests project.</p>

# Deployment
<p>Keep in mind that deploying an iOS app to the App Store requires having an Apple Developer account.</p>
1. Click on the "Product" menu in Xcode and select "Archive." This will create an archive of your project.
2. Once the archive has been created, select it in the Organizer window and click on the "Validate" button to perform some preliminary tests on the app.
3. Once validation is complete, click on the "Distribute" button and select "Ad Hoc" or "App Store" distribution. 
This will create a signed IPA file that can be installed on iOS devices.
4. Follow the prompts in the distribution wizard to complete the distribution process.
5. Once the distribution is complete, you can use the IPA file to install the app on iOS devices

# Dependencies
